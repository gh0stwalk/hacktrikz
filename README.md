# me... 🐱‍💻

Welcome, to my lair, mortal. Where the lines between chaos and brilliance blur. I'm not your average developer – I'm the one who builds tools that could either make or break your day. Here, we create *awesome* bots, *killer* apps, and tools that would make any hackermama proud. No rules. No limits. Just pure magic with a dash of darkness.

- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible (for when you want to make servers do your bidding)
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL (I’ve broken my share of SQL queries. Don’t @ me.)
- **Version Control**: Git (duh) – the only thing I can trust more than my own judgment
- **Other**: Networking, Pen Testing, API stuff, exploits, and occasionally causing some trouble.

## 😏 Fun Fact

I’m not here to make your life easier… I’m here to make your code better. So if you're brave enough, let's collab, break some things, and rebuild them better. Because *perfection is overrated*.
